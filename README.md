# WODIN demo

## Automatic deployment on wodin-dev

```
./wodin-deploy pull # if needed, pull containers
./wodin-deploy ssl  # if needed, update proxy ssl key/cert
./wodin-deploy down # if needed, stop existing deployment
./wodin-deploy up   # bring up the app
```

## Deployment for testing, without the proxy

```
./wodin-deploy up --no-proxy
```

## Manual deployment

Spin up the [odin.api](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin.api) server on a docker private network, then bring up [wodin](https://github.com/mrc-ide/wodin) pointing at our configuration directory

```
docker network create wodin-nw
docker run -d --pull=always --name odin.api --rm \
    --network=wodin-nw \
    mrcide/odin.api:main
docker run -d --pull=always --name wodin --rm \
    -p 3000:3000 --network=wodin-nw \
    -v $PWD/config:/config:ro \
    mrcide/wodin:main /config
```

The demo app will be available at http://localhost:3000

You can replace branch names on both components as required, but they must be compatible with one another (in terms of the code generated by odin.api and expected by wodin - `main`/`main` will always work, other combinations are possible).

In a production setting we would not expose port 3000 at all, but add a proxy to this network and expose everything over https.

## On metal

We can also run wodin on metal, without a docker container, with a few tweaks.

Bring up odin.api much as before, but this time we expose odin.api port to the host

```
docker run -d --name odin.api --rm \
    -p 8001:8001 \
    mrcide/odin.api:main
```

Edit the config/wodin.config.json to change the url of the `odinAPI` key to be `http://127.0.0.1:8001`

```json
{
    "courseTitle": "WODIN Example",
    "port": 3000,
    "appsPath": "apps",
    "odinAPI": "http://127.0.0.1:8001"
}
```

Then run

```
npm install
run run serve
```

The demo app will be available at http://localhost:3000

This requires that the npm package has been updated recently (not currently part of our workflows).

## Update local copy of configuration

Run

```
./update-config
```

to refresh the configuration in `/config` with that from the app, but with a sparkly new custom css and logo.
